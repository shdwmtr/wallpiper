## SMPTE-(EG)-1-1990 on video based wallpapers

Wine's `mfplat` falls back to rendering (EG) 1-1990 when a proprietary codec is not supported. 
This is outside the scope of `wallpiper`. Many existing proton based compatibility layers have fixes builtin.

For instance:

* [GE-Proton11-5-x86_64](https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/tag/GE-Proton11-5) (`winegstreamer` is the key library)

## Black Screen/Can't open Wallpaper Engine

Likely an issue with your underling translation layer. Only GE-Proton-11 and Valve-Proton-11 have been tested working. 

All users experiencing this issue fixed it upgrading to a later version of Proton. 

## GStreamer-WARNING: libbz2.so.1.0: No such file or directory (Fedora)

This error is Fedora-specific and is only seen at runtime, causing intermittent crashes in Wallpaper Engine even when idle. It can be fixed by creating a symbolic link for the critical library `libbz2.so.1.0`, as it is named `libbz2.so.1` in Fedora.

On standard Fedora distributions:

```
ln -s /usr/lib64/libbz2.so.1 /usr/lib64/libbz2.so.1.0
```

Immutable Fedora distributions (Fedora Silverblue, Aurora, Bazzite, etc.) will have to link this library to a user-accessible location. See [here](https://github.com/ublue-os/bazzite/issues/4978#issuecomment-4566369555) for an example of how to achieve this.

It is also worth ensuring GStreamer plugins are correctly installed. Check Freedesktop's installation instructions [here](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/installing/on-linux.html?gi-language=c).
